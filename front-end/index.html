        <h2>Company Story</h2>
        <div>Linkfire was founded in 2014 by two Danish marketers. It was their response to the increasingly complex
          nature of digital music marketing. Listeners the world over are streaming through different services—so how do
          you connect to all of them at once, simply and smartly?</div>
        <div>Our technology links fans directly to the content they love in their favorite app. At the same time, we
          empower everyone from major labels to independent artists with unparalleled audience insights.</div>
        <div>Since we started, we’ve become a trusted partner to the music industry’s biggest names, as well as
          thousands of soon-to-be biggest names. We’re headquartered in Copenhagen, with offices in NYC, LA, and
          Hamburg.</div>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <div>We’re developers, engineers, product managers, and more, drawn from every corner of the globe. The common
          denominator? Music—we live and breathe the stuff. Some of us are even successful musicians ourselves. So when
          we say ‘we rock’, we really do mean it.</div>
        <div>Linkfire is based across three time zones, in offices alive with possibility and purpose. Every day we help
          artists we adore realize their potential through the power of music data.</div>
        <div>Underpinning our culture are collaborative, agile processes, and something we like to call the ‘Nordic
          spirit.’
          It means working together with transparency, respect, and honesty. And that goes for the way we do business
          too.
